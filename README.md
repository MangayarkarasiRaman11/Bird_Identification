# Bird Identification App

The Bird Species Identification Web Application is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically recognize and classify bird species from user-uploaded images. Built using Python and Flask, the system integrates a pre-trained deep learning model, ResNet50, from the Keras library, trained on the ImageNet dataset. This model processes bird images by resizing and preprocessing them to extract deep visual features and generate predictions for the top three most probable bird species.
