# Bird Identification App

Bird Identification App is a react native(expo cli) application for identification of Indian birds species using convolutional neural networks. We have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build and train a model which can classify the birds from their images. 
We have used Keras, a deep learning framework built on top of TensorFlow 2.0, for building,training and testing our deep learning model.
Frontend is built using react native and firebase for authentication.
